# Text and Sentiment analysis of National Anthems around the world

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a repository for a collaborative project analyzing the lyrics of national anthems for countries around the world (trying to include as many as we can I think).

The data-set is derived from this [Github repository](https://github.com/lucas-de-sa/national-anthems-clustering). It contains the national anthems for 190 countries. This data-set is only a stepping-off point from which we will create and verify our own data-set with official lyrics and, potentially, added classifications.

Currently, the variables of the data-set are;

| Variables/ Column names | Description                                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| country                 | name of country                                         |
| alpha_2                 | countries alpha 2 ISO-code                              |
| alpha_3                 | countries alpha 3 ISO-code                              |
| continent               | continent where country is located (Note: 6 continents) |
| anthem                  | lyrics of national anthem                               |

# To-Do

  - Discover the official year that each national anthem was established, add to data set
  - Determine whether lyrics in data set are the official lyrics
  - Determine what countries may be omitted and whether these omissions should be added
  - Determine whether revisions to national anthems exist, when were revisions made official
  - Consider whether we should, for posterity, create a separate file with lyrics of national anthems in the national language of each respective country (especially considering that localization of translation may factor into any such analysis of sentiment)
  - Consider creating our own classifications for either sentiment or text analysis
  
## Just some random instructions for us

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
